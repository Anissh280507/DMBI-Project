🧠 Brain Tumor Detection/Classification using MRI✨ OverviewThis repository presents a deep learning solution for the automated detection and classification of Brain Tumors from MRI scans. The model is trained and validated on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset sourced from Kaggle.The primary goal is to accurately classify an input MRI image into one of the four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor, providing a high-accuracy tool to assist medical professionals in preliminary diagnostics.📊 Project DetailsDataset Source: Target Classes (4):GliomaMeningiomaPituitaryNo TumorModel Architecture: [e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), ResNet50, VGG16, Custom CNN]Task: Multi-class Image Classification (or Detection/Segmentation, if applicable)Key Results: Achieved an accuracy of [Your Final Accuracy]% on the test set.🚀 Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up the project environment and run the model.PrerequisitesPython 3.8+NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (recommended for deep learning)InstallationClone the repository:Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):Install the required libraries:(Ensure you have a requirements.txt listing all necessary packages like tensorflow/pytorch, numpy, pandas, opencv-python, matplotlib, scikit-learn.)DataThe original dataset is structured into image folders for each class.Download the dataset from the Kaggle link above.Place the image folders (e.g., Testing/, Training/) into a directory named data/raw within your project root.TrainingTo re-train the model from scratch, run the main training script:PredictionTo run inference on a new image:The output will display the predicted class and confidence score.📂 Repository Structure🧠 Model & MethodologyPreprocessingImage Standardization: All MRI images were resized to a uniform dimension of [e.g., $224 \times 224$] pixels.Normalization: Pixel values were scaled to the range [e.g., 0 to 1] for optimal model training.Data Augmentation: To prevent overfitting, techniques like [e.g., rotation, shifting, zooming, flipping] were applied to the training set images.ArchitectureThe model uses a [Model Name, e.g., fine-tuned ResNet-50] architecture. The final layers were adapted for a 4-class classification task, utilizing a Softmax activation function.Loss Function: [e.g., Categorical Crossentropy]Optimizer: [e.g., Adam] with a learning rate of [Your LR].📈 Results and EvaluationThe model was evaluated using a separate test set not used during training.A Confusion Matrix showing the per-class performance is available in the visualizations/ folder.👨‍💻 Author[Your Name/GitHub Username] - [e.g., Initial work, Training & Evaluation, etc.]📜 LicenseThis project is licensed under the [License Name, e.g., MIT] License - see the  file for details.
