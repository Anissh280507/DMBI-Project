# üß† Brain Tumor Detection & Classification using MRI  
*(DMBI-Project)*

This repository presents a **deep-learning solution** for the **automated detection and classification** of brain tumors using MRI scans. The model is trained and validated on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (sourced from Kaggle) and classifies each input image into one of four categories:  
- **Glioma**  
- **Meningioma**  
- **Pituitary**  
- **No Tumor**

This tool can assist medical professionals in preliminary diagnostics by providing a fast, reliable classification of MRI images.
